-------- NOTES --------
If the Frags Filter is not bound from a trigger, it becomes independent and is so always active.
Defrag is limited to 10 independent target_fragsFilters.
Independent frags filters are bugged: can't be triggered twice in single player mode (unless RESET flag is set); in multiplayer mode one player can block it for others.
Don't use such ones! Using trigger, connected to frags filter is highly recommended (trigger may be levelwide, if global behavior is required).

-------- NOTES --------
If LAUNCHER isn't specified the player will only be accelerated if he is moving
while the target_speed is triggered, as the player needs a moving direction and this is
only given when he moves. LAUNCHER will split the given speed value to the given
directions. Note that only one of the spawnflags for each coordinate must be set. For
example if +X and -X is active the x-direction will be ignored. The same is the case
if whether +X nor -X is active. So if you want to accelerate the player up with 900u
you have to set the speed value to 900 and activate the spawnflags +Z and LAUNCHER.

<flag key="WAIT_OFFSET" name="WAIT_OFFSET" bit="3">Adds the value of "target_number * wait_delay" to all delays. See notes.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
The keys for the targets have to contain 2 digits for the target number.
So "target1" won't work while "target01" is correct.
Target values should look like one of the following:
	delay_in_seconds:targetname
	targetname
Examples:
	1.5:my_target_door
	my_other_target_door

The first version will use the given delay while the second version will use the delay that is given
by the wait key of the multimanager entity. For those targets the wait delay is not added twice if
ADD_WAIT is set!

The multimanager can only be triggered again after all of its targets
were triggered! So the maximum of the delays is also the cooldown time.

Example for using the WAIT_OFFSET spawnflag:

target01: my_target1
target02: my_target2
target03: my_target3
target04: 2:my_target4

With a wait value of 0.5 the targets will have the following trigger delays:
target01: triggers my_target1 after 0.5 seconds
target02: triggers my_target2 after 1.0 seconds
target03: triggers my_target3 after 1.5 seconds
target04: triggers my_target4 after 4.0 seconds (special delay for this target is 2)

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
